# Contributing

We welcom any contribution from our users or fans. 

We are using 3 main branches for this repo:
 * master (development branch)
 * testing 
 * release

If you want to develop feature for the strato checkout the `master` branch and name it accordingly
`type` / `description`

good examples: 
* bugfix/glider_ratio_decimal_points
* widget/time_date
* feature/csv_logger
* utility/map_simulator

## Branch workflow

Any code additions are primary made to the `master` branch via PR only (except for branch house keeping).

Addiding features to `testing` are done by merge from `master`.

In rare cases you can check out `testing` to create bugfix, thease can be then merged directly.

Features to `release` are done by merge from `testing`.

In rare cases you can check out `release` to create bugfix, thease can be then merged directly.
