This directory contains the files to know the ground height. This is
needed to show height over ground and to draw maps showing a
topography.

Please put all AGL files into this directory. In order to do this,
please unzip the zip file containing the AGLs on your computer and
transfer all AGL files individually into this directory. You can also
unzip and transfer multiple countries. If they overlap by some AGL
files, simply ignore/overwrite.

The result should look like this:

agl
+-- N20E135.HGT
+-- N20E136.HGT
+-- N23E123.HGT
+-- N23E124.HGT
+-- N24E122.HGT
+-- N24E123.HGT
