This directory contains the files to know the ground height. This is
needed to show height over ground and to draw maps showing a
topography.

Please put all AGL files into this directory. In order to do this,
download the needed country zip files ending in "XXX_agl.zip" from
https://strato.skybean.eu/map/ and put the ZIP file into this
directory. On the next start of Strato the ZIP file will be extracted
and afterwards deleted. You will then see the individual HGT files
containing the height of the ground.

The result should look simliar to this. You will see files with the
latitude and longitude of the country, that you downloaded:
