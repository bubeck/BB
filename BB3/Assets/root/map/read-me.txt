This directory contains the files to draw everything on the map. It
contains streets, rivers and so on. The topography is taken from "agl"
directory.

Please put all MAP files into this directory. In order to do this,
download the needed country zip files ending in "XXX_map.zip" from
https://strato.skybean.eu/map/ and put the ZIP file into this
directory. On the next start of Strato the ZIP file will be extracted
and afterwards deleted. You will then see the individual MAP files
containing the map data.

The result should look simliar to this. You will see files with the
latitude and longitude of the country, that you downloaded:
