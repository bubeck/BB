This directory contains the files to draw everything on the map. It
contains streets, rivers and so on. The topography is taken from "agl"
directory.

Please put all MAP files into this directory. In order to do this,
please unzip the zip file containing the MAPs on your computer and
transfer all MAP files individually into this directory. You can also
unzip and transfer multiple countries. If they overlap by some MAP
files, simply ignore/overwrite.

The result should look like this:

map
+-- N20E135.MAP
+-- N20E136.MAP
+-- N23E123.MAP
+-- N23E124.MAP
+-- N24E122.MAP
+-- N24E123.MAP
...
