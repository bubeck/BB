*Compass heading

is shown in degrees, where true north is 0 (or 360), 90 is true east, 180 true south and 270 true west. Compass needs to be calibrated (as magnetometer) before flight for proper function. Compass shows vario orientation, GNSS heading is therefore much more useful, as it shows the current movement relative to the ground.
