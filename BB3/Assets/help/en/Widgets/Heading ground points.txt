*Simple ground heading

shows compass in 8 main directions (as a combination of N, E, S and W). GNSS heading is much more useful than compass, as it shows vario orientation, while GNSS heading shows the current movement relative to the ground. A GNSS fix is needed for this widget. This is a MUST HAVE widget.
