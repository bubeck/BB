*Vario profile

allows you to choose between different vario sound acoustic profiles.

There is a PC web server based editor for audio profile inside Strato. We don't recommend using this function on mobile phones, as it is optimized for PCs.
- connect vario to local Wi-Fi 
- put Network info number (IP address) to web browser on PC (chrome is recommended)
- click on Audio profile editor and follow instructions inside

You can also save/load profiles to/from files - Vario profile files are located in config > vario folder
Vario profile files (*.cfg) can be also edited via text editor, more details are in the profile folder.
